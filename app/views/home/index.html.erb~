<h1>We Are the Fauna</h1>
<p>We do pretend shapes, like the dark and pending storm clouds.</p>
<p>We do exist to seek out all the things that make the dream stay.</p>
<h1>I Looked Into The Mirror</h1>
<p>to ghost child. That's where all the little battles play out.</p>
<h1>I Breath In The Dust</h1>
<p>of a past that drifts in from the <b>endless forgetting</b></p>
